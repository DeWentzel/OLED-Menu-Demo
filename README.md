# OLED-Menu-Demo
This is a code for a SSD 1306 Oled display for a menu selection made to run on a Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi. 
You can navigate through the menu via using a joystick and button. It Also hosts a webserver that controls 
whatever components you would like. For Now it is just to start the screensaver remotely and turning on and 
off an LED on pin 13 (The Built in LED). The code does the following:

Displays a home screen
Displays a menu
Displays Distance from an Ultrasonic Sensor
Displays Current Weather
Displays a simple animation
Displays info for webserver

*NOTE: If you want to acces the webserver, you will have to enter the R4's IP adress in your web browser. 
You can find the IP adress under the INFO Tab in the menu on the OLED display.
